        Thanks for being one of the first users to try out the app.
        There\'s still heavy testing going on, so please feel free to
        contact me personally with any issues you notice when using the app.
        You can email me at ad@mfendley.com or tweet me @gravity_low.\n\n
        To help grow the app and make predictions more accurate, be sure to
        tell people about it and get them using it: the more users there are,
        the better calculations become about how crowded the dining halls are.
        Be sure to also leave feedback when \'re in a dining hall via the feedback
        tab that will appear; it helps let everyone else know what\'s going on!\n\n
        Have a great day and please enjoy!</string>
